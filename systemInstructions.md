## Introduction

**What's this document?**

This document serves as the foundational blueprint of our directory and its associated processes. It outlines our vision for a comprehensive and integrated system, aimed at simplifying navigation, parsing, and processing of various documents and files within the corresponding directory. This document is not yet a completed configuration; it represents an evolving framework that will be developed and refined over time.

As we progress, each aspect of this system – from the directory structure and naming conventions to parsing rules, metadata management, documentation standards, code guidelines, and audit processes – will be continually assessed, enhanced, and adapted to meet our dynamic needs. The goal is to create a cohesive understanding and provide a holistic view of the custom system that we are cultivating.

This living document covers the following aspects, each of which will have its own subsection within the "Configuration and Instructions" section:

- **Directory:** Outlines the proposed structure and logic to enhance navigation and clarity.
- **Naming Convention:** Drafts preliminary guidelines for naming various documents, files, and code scripts.
- **Parsing:** Suggests methods for structuring and interpreting markdown documents.
- **Metadata:** Describes the envisioned metadata framework and its potential applications.
- **Documentation:** Lays out initial approaches and templates for various types of documentation.
- **Code:** Begins to define coding standards and practices that align with our framework.
- **Audit:** Sketches out the initial concepts for version history and change log management systems.

Each of these components is subject to further development and refinement as we progress in finalizing our document during the completion phase.

## Configuration and Instructions

### Directory

**Overview:**

The directory serves as the backbone of our organizational system, ensuring seamless navigation and efficient management of all projects and documentation.

**Main Directory Contents:**

- `headquarters.md`: Outlines the company's details, mission and vision, risk and reward, strategic initiatives, and org structure.
- `systemInstructions.md`: Acts as a comprehensive guide, detailing the directory's usage, document processing, and navigation procedures.

**Sub-Directories:**

- `lab`: Each strategic initiative identified in `headquarters.md` has a dedicated sub-directory here. It's a hub for defining initiatives, managing projects, and storing all relevant working documents and files.
- `timeMachine`: A repository for all historical records, including technical and code documentation, archived documents, and project retrospectives.
- `tools`: Serves as a centralized repository for all the framework tools that will be developed over time such as directory tools, system tools, framework extensions, etc...

**Visual Directory Map:**

- Headquarters.md
- systemInstructions.md
- lab
- timeMachine
  - documentation
- tools
  - generateMarkdownTree.py

**Example File Paths:**

- **Main Directory:** `~/superPosition/`.
- **Headquarters Document:** `~/superPosition/Headquarters.md`.
- **System Development Initiative's Lab:** `~/superPosition/lab/systemDevelopmentLab/`.
- **Technical Documentation Directory:** `~/superPosition/timeMachine/documentation/technicalDocumentation`.

### Naming Convention

**General Rules:**

- **Capitalization**: Use `pascalCase` for multi-word names. Single-word names should be lowercase, except for prioritized files, which start with a capital letter.
- **Prioritization**: Files of high importance begin with a capitalized letter. When ordering is necessary, use a numeric prefix (e.g., `01_`, `02_`) to indicate sequence or priority. Two files with the same number means that the files have the same priority within the directory.
- **Brevity and Descriptiveness**: Names should be short yet descriptive, reflecting the file's content or purpose clearly.
- **Code Scripts**: Adopt an action-oriented naming style. Examples: `generateToC.py`, `convertMarkdownToPDF.py`.

**Naming Examples:**

- Correct: `Headquarters.md` (if prioritized), `systemInstructions.md`, `timeMachine`, `validateMVP.md`, `01_developMVP`.
- Wrong: `System_instructions.md`, `time_machine`, `Validte.MVP.md`, `01Develop_MVP`, `1_develop_mvp`.

**Special Cases and Examples:**

- **Acronyms and Industry Terms:** Maintain standard capitalization (e.g., `JSONparser.py`).
- **File Types:** These conventions apply to all files, including documents, scripts, and images.

### Parsing

**YAML Front Matter:**

- Every document begins with a YAML Front Matter section, identified by triple-dashed lines (`---`)at the start and end. This section includes essential metadata like the author, document type, tags, among other information (further defined in the metadata section below).

**Document Structure:**

- **Document Title:** Each document features a primary title marked as an H1 heading (`# Title`) used only once at the beginning of the document and right after the metadata front matter section.
- **Introduction Section:** Following the tile, each document starts with an H2 heading (`## Introduction`), offering an overview and context of the document.
- **Sections and Sub-Sections:**
  - The document is organized into sections (H2 headings, `##`) and sub-sections (H3 to H6 headings,. `###` to `######`).
  - A section or sub-section starts with its heading and concludes at the beginning of the next section (or sub-section) of the same or higher level.

**Content Formatting:**

- **List-Based Format:** The documents primarily use a list-based format for clarity and ease of parsing, especially for complex sections.
- **Special Instructions:** Sections with complex structures include specific parsing instructions at their beginning.

**Text Connotations:**

- **Bold Text(`**text**`)**: Used for emphasizing important terms, variables, and attributes.
- **Attribute and Value Definition:**
  - Standard attribute definition: `<!--Attribute-->`value``.
  - Hidden attribute/value definition: `<!--attribute`value`-->`.
- **Examples:**
  - Color attribute: `<!--thisColor-->`Blue``
  - Section End: `<!--sectionEnd`Introduction```
  - Instructional note: `<!--chatGPT`summarize this section``

**Tone and Style:**

- Maintain a concise, informative style with bulleted lists for easy digestion and clarity.
- Ensure the content is accessible and straightforward, optimized for both human readers and automated parsing/processing.
- Use simple language to avoid complexity and confusion.
- Avoid excessive nesting of sections and sub-sections to maintain readability.
- Strive for completeness in information while avoiding redundancy.

### Metadata

**Overview:**
Metadata in our system plays a crucial role in organizing, formatting, and processing documents. It;s defined in the `YAML` Front Matter at the start of each document, enclosed by triple-dashed lines. The structured approach to metadata allows for efficient handling by both custom scripts and various tools.

**Structure of Metadata:**

- **Front Matter:** All documents begin with a YAML: front matter section that includes key metadata items and their values.
- **Usage:** Metadata is essential for static site generators and other tools to correctly format and display documents.
- **Extraction and Automation:** Our system is designed for easy extraction of metadata using Python scripts and existing tools, enhancing our ability to manage and utilize this data effectively.

**Types of Metadata:**

- **Global Metadata:**
  - **Purpose:** Sets system-wide defaults and templates.
  - **Management:** It's centrally managed and updated, with preset values standard across all documents.
  - **Database Link:** Updates and information on global metadata can be found in our [Google Sheets Metadata Database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MBcI2KwG9UkHH0Snlp5Qs-uinSISRUUgqJj-HrFUzC8/edit#gid=0)
- **Project-Specific Metadata:**
  - To be defined if and when the need arises.

**Metadata Workflows:**

- **Accuracy and Efficiency:** Regular Python scripts are employed to check and refine metadata, aiming for at least 95% accuracy in definitions.
- **Future Plans:** We intend to automate the process of metadata definition and make real-time adjustments, continually enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of our metadata usage.
