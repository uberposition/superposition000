### Backstory by RH

- After around 14 years of professional experience, I decided to attempt launching a company on my own.
- It all started after I resigned from my job as the COO of a staffing on demand tech startup in Dubai.
- After quickly turning around the company's fate and saving it from imminent bankruptcy within the first five months, I spent the remaining two years co-founding the company.
- The CEO led the sales, marketing, and funding while I led everything else except for finance.
- We managed to close a successful series A funding round for $3,000,000.
- Having proved myself as a COO and entrepreneur more than once throughout my career, it's worth attempting making it on my own terms.
- Additionally, I have extensive experience and a long track record filled with successful automation and optimization solutions for different gig economy and on demand tech companies.
- Due to the lack of a robust business idea, I'm exploring multiple avenues at once in an effort to come up with a solid business idea.
- The main logic behind my approach is to start with creating a customized integrated project management framework powered by AI language models.
- Using the framework will allow me to efficiently manage multiple sophisticated projects at once while I continue to optimize the framework itself by treating it as one of the projects.
- Therefore my first project will be the `projSystemOne` which will focus on putting together the `LPF` framework I mentioned above.
- I spent most of this year (2023) researching, learning, and working with the leading language model AI solutions.
- I also had countless conversations with potential partners and different people with different ideas.
- I've also done a lot of work on different fronts.
- Once I have the foundational framework, I will merge my old work with the new framework and directory and proceed to introducing the remaining aspects of my approach.
- The main idea is to build the different versions of the framework's MVP and validate whether it can be wrapped as a business or consumer product.
- If it's possible, the AI Framework will be the main business idea.
- However, if it can't be productised, it will be used to develop the below-mentioned projects along with additional ideas that will be identified and defined over time.
- The second project is a by-product of the first project and has to do with leveraging language models to optimize customer support. It's essentially the ability to train a language model on a dataset.
- The third project or area of focus has to do with scraping in general. It's an important aspect of my framework's vision in terms of intelligence data gathering, competition tracking, among many other use cases.
- The fourth project builds on top of the third project where it uses scraping technology to extract data from food aggregator apps to analyze different F&B metrics on a market/food aggregator level.
- The fourth project ends if and when we manage to create a cohesive end to end solution for restaurant owners where we handle and automate their food aggregator day to day strategic and implementation tasks.
- This is my story and that's how I'm trying to get back on track. I could be absolutely crazy, however, I'm committed to trying. I committed to this risk.
